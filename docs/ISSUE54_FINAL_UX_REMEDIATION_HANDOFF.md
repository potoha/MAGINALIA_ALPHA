# Issue #54 Final UX Remediation — Implementation Handoff

**Implementation status:** Required remediation is implemented and pushed to Draft Desktop PR #70. Product Owner acceptance is pending.

## Base and result

- Desktop repository: potoha/MAGINALIA_desktop (local source checkout is MAGINALIA_ALPHA).
- PR: [#70](https://github.com/potoha/MAGINALIA_desktop/pull/70), base dev0.2 at 1e0fe37cfdfa4ad369ccff1d4f07f68d5277a86c.
- Required starting head: 693144272705ebf5a0fa647a936ffed03fe5576e.
- Implementation commit: 6c9adb4598c302c21fd9d15a5e9b03a4110746ad.
- Branch/worktree: codex/issue-54-settings-keybindings, C:\Users\PolarBear\.codex\worktrees\desktop-work\MAGINALIA_ALPHA.
- PR #70 remains Draft. No merge, release, or Issue #54 closure was performed.

## Implemented behavior

- Reworked the palette into a high-contrast light surface with explicit input, result, selected/hover, secondary text, shortcut, empty-state, and focus styles. The palette remains backed by the Command Registry for executable actions.
- Added fuzzy, relevance-ranked results, match highlighting, categories, effective shortcut labels, IME-safe keyboard handling, arrow selection with scroll-into-view, Enter execution, Escape cancellation, and focus restoration.
- Separated > command search, ? help, project: registered-Project name navigation, and file: active-Project document name navigation. Project and document contents are not searched.
- Project results use the Workdesk display title and opaque registration identity. Opening revalidates the current Workdesk and registration, then uses the existing dirty-document/autosave gate before loading. File results use display names and opaque file IDs through existing Project navigation and document sessions; open documents are reactivated rather than duplicated.
- Audited current user-facing actions and routed the remaining local Repository/History controls through stable Registry actions. No remote GitHub synchronization path was added.
- Registered active-document Find and Replace through the Registry and invoke Monaco's native actions in Edit mode. Preview disables these commands; no parallel editing/search engine was added.

## Acceptance and verification

### PASS

- Palette readability: real Electron contrast measurements were palette surface 13.06:1, input 13.28:1, message 6.87:1, title 10.85:1, category 6.19:1, description 5.70:1, shortcut 6.19:1, match highlight 10.70:1, and focus 13.06:1. Ordinary text exceeds 4.5:1.
- Real Electron screenshots are checked in: [selected result](issue54-evidence/command-palette-selected.png) and [empty state](issue54-evidence/command-palette-empty.png).
- npm run typecheck --workspace @maginalia/desktop.
- npm run build --workspace @maginalia/desktop.
- Focused Vitest run: 9 files, 119 tests passed, covering palette, registry/context, keybindings, Project/document navigation, controller behavior, and menu contracts.
- node apps/desktop/test/project-smoke.mjs: passed both smoke launches.
- node apps/desktop/test/h-smoke.mjs: passed both smoke launches, including registered Project selection, name-based Quick Open, duplicate-tab protection, native Monaco Find/Replace widget behavior, Preview gating, and source preservation.
- Workbench UI Electron smoke, with MAGINALIA_COMMAND_PALETTE_EVIDENCE_DIR set to the absolute repository path C:\Users\PolarBear\.codex\worktrees\desktop-work\MAGINALIA_ALPHA\docs\issue54-evidence: passed interaction, keyboard/focus/IME checks, screenshots, and contrast assertions.
- Keybinding tests cover default Ctrl+P / Ctrl+Shift+P, a customized Mod+Alt+P binding, disabled commands, and the current effective shortcut labels. Project controller tests cover canceled/failed flushes and prove the deferred Project loader does not run before the dirty-document safeguard succeeds. Find/Replace controller tests cover LF/CRLF text, selection and Undo behavior; Electron smoke verifies Monaco widgets open without changing the source.
- git diff --check.

### FAIL

- None observed in the final verification commands listed above.

### NOT VERIFIED

- The full Desktop test suite was not rerun for this remediation. A previous run recorded one tutorial-sample CRLF/LF assertion failure reproduced on the untouched base; it remains historical baseline debt and is not re-evaluated here.
- Physical Windows user acceptance and Electron behavior on macOS/Linux remain unverified.
- The linked advisory Figma file contains Settings and shortcut-related states but no Command Palette frame; a direct Figma-to-palette visual comparison was unavailable.
- Final Product Owner acceptance remains pending.

## Canonical plan and next action

The requested write-back is proposed in MAGINALIA_IDE PR #17, currently Draft. It updates plan/19_DESKTOP_RENDERER_EDITOR_INTERACTION.md with the explicit name-only navigation refinement and plan/23_POST_MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md with this evidence. It does not mark Phase A/B DONE. Canonical publication is pending review and merge of that documentation PR.

Next action: Product Owner reviews the Draft PR and performs the remaining human acceptance. Keep Issue #54 open and do not merge or release until that acceptance is explicit.
